# Fibonacci Laws of Planetary Motion

This document describes the Fibonacci Laws of Planetary Motion as implemented in the Holistic Universe Model. Six laws connect planetary orbital parameters through Fibonacci numbers: a cycle hierarchy, inclination and eccentricity constants, two independent balance conditions, and a resonance loop.

---

## Overview

The six Fibonacci Laws form a layered architecture:

- **Law 1** (Fibonacci Cycle Hierarchy) — all major precession periods derive from the Holistic Year divided by Fibonacci numbers
- **Laws 2–3** (Inclination Constant + Balance) — each planet's inclination amplitude is quantized by a Fibonacci divisor, and the mass-weighted amplitudes cancel between two phase groups
- **Laws 4–5** (Eccentricity Constant + Balance) — all 8 eccentricities are determined by Fibonacci pair constraints on the AMD partition ratio, and satisfy an independent balance condition
- **Law 6** (Saturn-Jupiter-Earth Resonance) — a closed beat-frequency loop linking three dominant precession periods

For detailed mathematical derivations and formula coefficient breakdowns, see [Formula Derivation](35-formula-derivation.md).

The central formula for inclination amplitudes is:

```
amplitude = ψ / (d × √m)
```

Where:
- `ψ` = Universal coupling constant, derived from Fibonacci numbers
- `d` = Fibonacci divisor (a Fibonacci number: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...)
- `√m` = Square root of planetary mass in solar units

## Fundamental Constants

### The Holistic Year

```
H = see Constants Reference for current value
```

### The ψ-Constant

Derived from Fibonacci numbers and the Holistic Year:

```
ψ = (F₅ × F₈²) / (2H) = (5 × 21²) / (2H) = 2205 / (2H)
```

### Planetary Data (JPL DE440)

| Planet | Mass (M☉) | √m | a (AU) | e | i J2000 (°) | Ω J2000 (°) |
|--------|-----------|-----|--------|---|------------|-------------|
| Mercury | 1.6601 × 10⁻⁷ | 4.074 × 10⁻⁴ | 0.3871 | 0.2056 | 6.3473 | 32.83 |
| Venus | 2.4478 × 10⁻⁶ | 1.564 × 10⁻³ | 0.7233 | 0.0068 | 2.1545 | 54.70 |
| Earth | 3.0027 × 10⁻⁶ | 1.733 × 10⁻³ | 1.0000 | 0.0167 | 1.5787 | 284.51 |
| Mars | 3.2271 × 10⁻⁷ | 5.681 × 10⁻⁴ | 1.5237 | 0.0934 | 1.6312 | 354.87 |
| Jupiter | 9.5479 × 10⁻⁴ | 3.090 × 10⁻² | 5.2029 | 0.0484 | 0.3220 | 312.89 |
| Saturn | 2.8588 × 10⁻⁴ | 1.691 × 10⁻² | 9.5367 | 0.0539 | 0.9255 | 118.81 |
| Uranus | 4.3662 × 10⁻⁵ | 6.608 × 10⁻³ | 19.189 | 0.0473 | 0.9947 | 307.80 |
| Neptune | 5.1514 × 10⁻⁵ | 7.177 × 10⁻³ | 30.070 | 0.0086 | 0.7354 | 192.04 |

Where a = semi-major axis, e = eccentricity, i J2000 = inclination to the invariable plane at J2000, Ω J2000 = longitude of ascending node on the invariable plane at J2000 epoch (Souami & Souchay 2012, verified).

**Note on Earth's eccentricity:** The J2000 value (0.0167) is used for the balance calculations (Laws 3 and 5), consistent with all other planets. Earth's mean eccentricity over the Holistic Year (0.0153, used in the 3D simulation) differs due to long-term oscillation. The impact on balance is negligible — Earth's eccentricity weight is tiny compared to the gas giants — but Law 4 (eccentricity constant, mean table), and Finding 5 (eccentricity ladder) use the mean value for long-term structural relationships.

## The Six Laws

### Law 1: Fibonacci Cycle Hierarchy

All major precession periods derive from the Holistic Year divided by Fibonacci numbers:

| F(n) | Period = H/F(n) | Astronomical meaning |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 3 | H/3 | Earth inclination precession |
| 5 | H/5 | Jupiter perihelion precession |
| 8 | H/8 | Saturn perihelion precession (retrograde) |
| 13 | H/13 | Earth axial precession |
| 21 | H/21 | Beat: axial + obliquity |
| 34 | H/34 | Beat: axial + ecliptic |

Beat frequency rule: `1/H(n) + 1/H(n+1) = 1/H(n+2)` — an algebraic identity from the Fibonacci recurrence.

### Law 2: The Inclination Constant

Each planet's mass-weighted inclination amplitude, multiplied by its Fibonacci divisor, equals the universal ψ-constant:

```
d × amplitude × √m = ψ
```

Equivalently:

```
amplitude = ψ / (d × √m)
```

This holds for all 8 planets with a single universal ψ = 3.288 × 10⁻³.

### Law 3: The Inclination Balance

The angular-momentum-weighted inclination amplitudes cancel between the two phase groups, conserving the orientation of the invariable plane:

```
Σ(203° group) L_j × amp_j = Σ(23° group) L_j × amp_j
```

Substituting Law 2 and simplifying:

```
Σ(203°) w_j = Σ(23°) w_j

where w_j = √(m_j × a_j(1-e_j²)) / d_j
```

**Result: 100% balance.** See [Inclination Balance Derivation](#inclination-balance-derivation) for the full treatment.

### Law 4: The Eccentricity Constant

All 8 planetary eccentricities are determined by Fibonacci pair constraints on the AMD (Angular Momentum Deficit) partition ratio `R = e / i_mean_rad`. Within each mirror pair, R values satisfy two independent Fibonacci constraints — a sum and a product or ratio — providing two equations for two unknowns:

| Mirror pair | R²_sum | Fibonacci | R product/ratio | Fibonacci |
|-------------|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Mercury / Uranus | 10.5 | 21/2 | R_Me / R_Ur | 2/3 |
| Venus / Neptune | 0.5 | 1/2 | R_Ve / R_Ne | 2/8 |
| Earth / Saturn | 11.33 | 34/3 | R_Ea × R_Sa | 2 |
| Mars / Jupiter | 75.4 | 377/5 | R_Ma × R_Ju | 34/2 |

This determines all 8 eccentricities from Law 2 inclinations with 0 free parameters. See [Eccentricity Constant Derivation](#eccentricity-constant-derivation) for the full treatment.

### Law 5: The Eccentricity Balance

The eccentricities satisfy an independent balance condition using the same Fibonacci divisors and phase groups:

```
Σ(203° group) v_j = Σ(23° group) v_j

where v_j = √m_j × a_j^(3/2) × e_j / √d_j
```

Or equivalently, in terms of orbital period `T_j ∝ a_j^(3/2)`:

```
v_j = T_j × e_j × √(m_j / d_j)
```

**Result: 100% balance** (dual-balanced eccentricities). See [Eccentricity Balance Derivation](#eccentricity-balance-derivation) for the full treatment and [Eccentricity Balance Scale](38-eccentricity-scale.md) for a physical interpretation as a balance scale.

#### The Eccentricity Amplitude Constant

While eccentricity base values are determined by the balance system (Laws 4 + 5), the eccentricity **amplitude** — how much each planet's eccentricity oscillates over its eccentricity cycle — has a genuine universal constant, analogous to ψ for inclination:

```
e_amp = K × sin(tilt) × √d / (√m × a^1.5)
```

K = 3.4505 × 10⁻⁶ — an empirical constant derived from Earth's mean parameters. The total eccentricity at any time oscillates around the base value with this amplitude over each planet's eccentricity cycle. Two candidate relations K ≈ ψ²/π (0.09%) and K ≈ ψ^(11/5) (0.05%) have been noted but are not proven identities. See [Eccentricity Balance Scale](38-eccentricity-scale.md) for details.

### Law 6: Saturn-Jupiter-Earth Resonance

Saturn's retrograde precession creates a closed beat-frequency loop linking the three dominant precession periods:

```
Jupiter + Saturn → Axial:       1/(H/5) + 1/(H/8) = 1/(H/13)
Jupiter − Saturn → Earth incl:  1/(H/5) − 1/(−H/8) = 1/(H/3)
Axial − Earth   → Obliquity:    1/(H/13) − 1/(H/3) = 1/(H/8) → Saturn
```

Each frequency sum/difference returns another Fibonacci period (H/5, H/8, H/13, H/3). The loop closes because the Fibonacci recurrence `F(n) + F(n+1) = F(n+2)` maps directly to beat frequencies: `1/H(n) + 1/H(n+1) = 1/H(n+2)`.

## Assignments

### Fibonacci Divisors

| Planet | d | Fibonacci | Phase group |
|--------|---|-----------|-------------|
| Mercury | 21 | F₈ | 203° |
| Venus | 34 | F₉ | 203° |
| Earth | 3 | F₄ | 203° |
| Mars | 5 | F₅ | 203° |
| Jupiter | 5 | F₅ | 203° |
| Saturn | 3 | F₄ | 23° |
| Uranus | 21 | F₈ | 203° |
| Neptune | 34 | F₉ | 203° |

### Phase Groups

The model uses two phase angles, 180° apart, derived from the s₈ eigenmode of Laplace-Lagrange secular perturbation theory (γ₈ ≈ 203.3195°):

| Phase angle | Planets |
|-------------|---------|
| **203.3195°** | Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune |
| **23.3195°** | Saturn (retrograde, solo) |

The group assignment is constrained by: (1) each planet's oscillation range must fall within the Laplace-Lagrange secular theory bounds, (2) the inclination structural weights must balance (Law 3), and (3) the eccentricity weights must balance (Law 5).

### Precession Periods

| Planet | Expression |
|--------|------------|
| Mercury | H / (1+3/8) |
| Venus | 2H |
| Earth | H/3 |
| Mars | H / (4+1/3) |
| Jupiter | H/5 |
| Saturn | −H/8 (retrograde) |
| Uranus | H/3 |
| Neptune | 2H |

## Findings

Findings are empirical observations and consequences that follow from the six laws.

### Finding 1: Mirror Symmetry

Each inner planet shares its Fibonacci divisor with its outer counterpart across the asteroid belt:

| Level | Inner planet | Outer planet | Shared d | Fibonacci |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Belt-adjacent | Mars (d=5) | Jupiter (d=5) | 5 | F₅ |
| Middle | Earth (d=3) | Saturn (d=3) | 3 | F₄ |
| Far | Venus (d=34) | Neptune (d=34) | 34 | F₉ |
| Outermost | Mercury (d=21) | Uranus (d=21) | 21 | F₈ |

Earth–Saturn is the only pair with opposite phase groups (203° vs 23°). The divisors form two consecutive Fibonacci pairs: (3, 5) for the belt-adjacent planets and (21, 34) for the outer planets.

### Finding 2: Configuration Uniqueness

The exhaustive search evaluates 7,558,272 configurations (see [Exhaustive Search](#exhaustive-search-and-preset-generation)). Four independent filters constrain the solution space:

- **Balance ≥ 99.994%** — the inclination balance exceeds the TNO margin
- **Mirror symmetry** — inner/outer d-values match across the asteroid belt (Me↔Ur, Ve↔Ne, Ea↔Sa, Ma↔Ju)
- **Saturn-solo** — Saturn is the only planet at the 23° phase angle (all others at 203°)
- **LL bounds** — all 8 planets' inclination ranges fall within Laplace-Lagrange secular theory bounds

These are overlapping, not nested, constraints (full analysis: [configuration-analysis.js](../tools/verify/configuration-analysis.js)):

| Filter | Count | % of total |
|--------|------:|------------|
| Total search space | 7,558,272 | 100% |
| **Single filters** | | |
| Balance ≥ 99.994% | 737 | 0.00975% |
| Mirror-symmetric | 2,592 | 0.0343% |
| Saturn-solo | 236,196 | 3.125% |
| LL bounds | 739,200 | 9.780% |
| **Two-filter intersections** | | |
| Mirror ∩ Balance | 1 | 0.0000132% |
| Saturn-solo ∩ Balance | 15 | 0.000199% |
| Saturn-solo ∩ LL bounds | 36,288 | 0.480% |
| Mirror ∩ Saturn-solo | 81 | 0.00107% |
| Mirror ∩ LL bounds | 380 | 0.00503% |
| Balance ∩ LL bounds | 180 | 0.00238% |
| **Three-filter intersections** | | |
| Saturn-solo ∩ Balance ∩ LL bounds | 5 | 0.0000662% |
| Mirror ∩ Saturn-solo ∩ LL bounds | 36 | 0.000476% |
| Mirror ∩ Saturn-solo ∩ Balance | 1 | 0.0000132% |
| Mirror ∩ Balance ∩ LL bounds | 1 | 0.0000132% |
| **All four filters** | | |
| Mirror ∩ Saturn-solo ∩ LL bounds ∩ Balance ≥ 99.994% | **1** | 0.0000132% |

That single configuration is **Config #15** (Me=21, Ve=34, Ea=3, Ma=5, Ju=5, Sa=3, Ur=21, Ne=34).

**Key structural constraints:**

- **Mirror symmetry requires Scenario A.** Since Earth is locked at d=3, the Earth↔Saturn mirror pair forces Sa=3, which only occurs in Scenario A (Ju=5, Sa=3). Scenarios B/C/D have zero mirror-symmetric configurations.
- **LL bounds impose a floor of d ≥ 5** for the free mirror pairs (Mercury↔Uranus and Venus↔Neptune). Of the 81 mirror + Saturn-solo configs, 36 pass LL bounds — exactly the 6 × 6 grid where both pair d-values are ≥ 5.
- **Balance selects one.** Among those 36 LL-valid mirror + Saturn-solo configs, only Config #15 achieves balance ≥ 99.994% (at 100%).

The mirror symmetry, combined with the six laws, uniquely determines all 8 Fibonacci divisor assignments.

### Finding 3: Eccentricity Balance Independence

The eccentricity balance (Law 5) is genuinely independent from the inclination balance (Law 3):

- The weight formulas differ: `w_j = √(m·a(1-e²))/d` (inclination) vs `v_j = √m × a^(3/2) × e / √d` (eccentricity)
- The ratio v_j/w_j varies by a factor of ~150 across planets — the two balance conditions are not proportional
- The coefficient `√m × a^(3/2) / √d` alone (without e) gives only 74% balance; the actual eccentricity values improve it to 100%
- Random eccentricity values in the same weight formula give 50–85% balance

The two balances also differ structurally. The inclination balance is a **global** property — all mass in the solar system contributes (TNOs provide a 0.0002% correction). The eccentricity balance is a **closed-system** property of the 8 planets — the mirror pairs act as "communicating vessels" exchanging Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD), and TNOs cannot participate because (a) they lack paired counterparts, (b) the a^(3/2) weighting makes them far too heavy for any Fibonacci d-factor, and (c) they are test particles that cannot shape the eigenmode structure. See [eccentricity-balance.js](../tools/verify/eccentricity-balance.js) for the quantitative analysis.

### Finding 4: Saturn Eccentricity Prediction and Law Convergence

Since Saturn is the sole retrograde planet, the eccentricity balance directly predicts its eccentricity from the other seven:

```
e_Saturn = Σ(203° group) v_j / (√m_Sa × a_Sa^(3/2) / √d_Sa)
```

| Source | e_Saturn | vs J2000 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Law 4 prediction (R² pair constraint) | 0.05389 | +0.05% |
| Law 5 prediction (eccentricity balance) | 0.05374 | −0.22% |
| J2000 observed (JPL DE440) | 0.05386 | — |

**Law convergence:** Laws 4 and 5 independently predict Saturn's eccentricity to within **0.30%** of each other. Law 4 derives it from the R² pair constraint (n²_sum = 34/3, R_Ea × R_Sa = 2) — a purely structural Fibonacci relation. Law 5 derives it from the global balance equation — involving all eight planets simultaneously. Both bracket the J2000 observed value: Law 4 overshoots by 0.05%, Law 5 undershoots by 0.22%.

**Why this is significant:** Saturn's eccentricity oscillates secularly between ~0.01 and ~0.09 (a factor-of-9 dynamic range). Two structurally different Fibonacci constraints — one using only the Earth–Saturn pair, the other using all eight planets — independently predict a value within 0.3% of each other and within 0.25% of J2000 across this range. The Fibonacci divisors were originally chosen to match precession periods (Law 1) and inclination balance (Law 3); the eccentricity predictions were never optimized for. That two independent equations, drawing on different subsets of planetary data, converge on the same value confirms that the eccentricity balance is not an independent free parameter but an emergent consequence of the Fibonacci pair structure.

**Epoch independence:** The convergence is not a coincidence of the J2000 epoch. The mirror pairs act as communicating vessels that exchange AMD (Angular Momentum Deficit) secularly: when Saturn's eccentricity rises, Earth's falls, and vice versa. When all four pairs co-evolve with AMD conservation, the balance stays within 99.8–99.9% across Saturn's entire upper secular range (e = 0.054–0.088), compared to a 36–100% swing if Saturn oscillates alone. At any epoch where all pairs have co-evolved, computing the "perfect-balance Saturn e" from the other seven planets' actual eccentricities yields a value within 0.2–0.4% of Saturn's actual eccentricity — the convergence is maintained structurally, not by chance of timing. Only configurations already near 100% balance produce corrections small enough for Law 4 to confirm independently; an 80% configuration would require a 33% correction that no independent law predicts. See [epoch-independence.js](../tools/verify/epoch-independence.js) for the full analysis.

With dual-balanced eccentricities, the eccentricity balance reaches 100%. The model's eccentricities are optimized to satisfy both the inclination balance (Law 3) and eccentricity balance (Law 5) simultaneously. See [eccentricity-balance.js](../tools/verify/eccentricity-balance.js) for the static analysis.

### Finding 5: Inner Planet Eccentricity Ladder

The mass-weighted eccentricities of the four inner planets form a Fibonacci ratio sequence:

```
ξ_Venus : ξ_Earth : ξ_Mars : ξ_Mercury = 1 : 5/2 : 5 : 8
```

Where `ξ = e × √m`. Consecutive ratios are 5/2, 2, 8/5 — all converging toward the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618.

---

## Inclination Balance Derivation

The invariable plane is perpendicular to the total angular momentum vector of the solar system. For this plane to remain stable, the angular-momentum-weighted inclination oscillations must cancel between the two phase groups.

Each planet's inclination oscillates as:

```
i_j(t) = mean_j + amp_j × cos(Ω_j(t) - φ_group)
```

The Z-component of angular momentum is `Lz_j ∝ L_j × cos(i_j)`. For small inclinations, the oscillating part of the total Lz is proportional to:

```
Σ L_j × amp_j × cos(Ω_j(t) - φ_group) ≈ 0   (for all t)
```

In the two-group model, planets in each group oscillate together (with 180° phase offset). The balance condition is:

```
Σ(203° group) L_j × amp_j = Σ(23° group) L_j × amp_j
```

### Substituting the Fibonacci Formula

With `amp_j = ψ / (d_j × √m_j)` and `L_j = m_j × √(a_j × (1 - e_j²))`:

```
L_j × amp_j = ψ × m_j × √(a_j(1-e_j²)) / (d_j × √m_j)
             = ψ × √(m_j × a_j(1-e_j²)) / d_j
             = ψ × w_j
```

Since ψ is a single universal constant, it cancels from both sides:

```
Σ(203°) w_j = Σ(23°) w_j
```

Where `w_j = √(m_j × a_j(1-e_j²)) / d_j` is the structural weight for each planet.

### Structural Weights

| Planet | Group | d | w_j |
|--------|-------|---|-----|
| Mercury | 203° | 21 | 1.181 × 10⁻⁵ |
| Venus | 203° | 34 | 3.914 × 10⁻⁵ |
| Earth | 203° | 3 | 5.776 × 10⁻⁴ |
| Mars | 203° | 5 | 1.396 × 10⁻⁴ |
| Jupiter | 203° | 5 | 1.408 × 10⁻² |
| Uranus | 203° | 21 | 1.375 × 10⁻³ |
| Neptune | 203° | 34 | 1.155 × 10⁻³ |
| Saturn | 23° | 3 | 1.737 × 10⁻² |

```
Σ(203°) w = 1.7374 × 10⁻²
Σ(23°)  w = 1.7374 × 10⁻²

Difference: 5.4 × 10⁻⁸
Balance: 100%
```

Jupiter (d=5) contributes the dominant 203° weight (1.408 × 10⁻²). The remaining six planets collectively contribute 3.29 × 10⁻³ to match Saturn's total of 1.737 × 10⁻².

### TNO Contribution

The balance considers only the 8 major planets, which carry 99.994% of the solar system's orbital angular momentum. Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) contribute the remaining ~0.006%, tilting the invariable plane by approximately 1.25″ ([Li, Xia & Zhou 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11293)). The 0.0002% residual imbalance is well within this TNO margin.

---

## Eccentricity Balance Derivation

### The Balance Condition

The eccentricity balance states that orbital-period-weighted eccentricities, scaled by √(mass / Fibonacci divisor), cancel between the two phase groups:

```
Σ(203°) v_j = Σ(23°) v_j

where v_j = √m_j × a_j^(3/2) × e_j / √d_j
```

### Physical Interpretation

The weight `v_j` can be decomposed as:

```
v_j = T_j × e_j × √(m_j / d_j)
```

where `T_j = a_j^(3/2)` is the orbital period (in units where T_Earth = 1 year). The terms have natural interpretations:
- `T_j × √m_j` is the mass-period product (`√m × a^(3/2)`), related to the orbit-averaged radial action
- `e_j / √d_j` is the eccentricity scaled by the square root of the Fibonacci divisor

Comparing the two balance weights:

| Property | Inclination weight w_j | Eccentricity weight v_j |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Formula | √(m × a(1-e²)) / d | √m × a^(3/2) × e / √d |
| d scaling | 1/d | 1/√d |
| a scaling | √a | a^(3/2) |
| e role | Weak (1-e² ≈ 1) | Direct (linear in e) |

The half-power difference in Fibonacci divisor scaling (1/d vs 1/√d) and the shift from √a to a^(3/2) reflect that the eccentricity balance operates at a different order in secular perturbation theory.

### Eccentricity Balance Weights

| Planet | Group | d | v_j = √m × a^(3/2) × e / √d |
|--------|-------|---|------|
| Mercury | 203° | 21 | 4.404 × 10⁻⁶ |
| Venus | 203° | 34 | 1.119 × 10⁻⁶ |
| Earth | 203° | 3 | 1.672 × 10⁻⁵ |
| Mars | 203° | 5 | 4.463 × 10⁻⁵ |
| Jupiter | 203° | 5 | 7.928 × 10⁻³ |
| Uranus | 203° | 21 | 5.705 × 10⁻³ |
| Neptune | 203° | 34 | 1.734 × 10⁻³ |
| Saturn | 23° | 3 | 1.547 × 10⁻² |

```
Σ(203°) v = 1.543 × 10⁻²
Σ(23°)  v = 1.547 × 10⁻²

Balance: 100%
```

Saturn alone carries the entire 23° contribution. The 203° group is dominated by Jupiter (7.928 × 10⁻³), Uranus (5.705 × 10⁻³), and Neptune (1.734 × 10⁻³), with the four inner planets contributing only 6.6 × 10⁻⁵ combined.

### Mirror Pair Decomposition

The gap decomposes by mirror pair into four contributions that nearly cancel:

| Pair | d | Gap contribution | % of total gap |
|------|---|-----------------|----------------|
| Earth ↔ Saturn | 3 | +1.545 × 10⁻² | +42,504% |
| Mars ↔ Jupiter | 5 | −7.973 × 10⁻³ | −21,928% |
| Mercury ↔ Uranus | 21 | −5.710 × 10⁻³ | −15,704% |
| Venus ↔ Neptune | 34 | −1.735 × 10⁻³ | −4,773% |
| **Sum** | | **3.636 × 10⁻⁵** | **100%** |

Four numbers spanning ±42,000% cancel to leave a negligible residual. The Earth–Saturn pair dominates because Saturn (23° group) is 925× heavier than Earth in eccentricity weight, creating a large surplus. The three 203°-only pairs (Mars–Jupiter, Mercury–Uranus, Venus–Neptune) collectively compensate, with Jupiter and Uranus providing the bulk of the compensation. The balance emerges from the "communicating vessel" structure of AMD exchange between paired planets.

### Non-Triviality

Three tests confirm the eccentricity balance is a genuine constraint on eccentricity values, not a structural artifact:

1. **Coefficient test**: The weight formula without eccentricities (`√m × a^(3/2) / √d`) gives only 74% balance — the eccentricity values contribute 26 percentage points of improvement
2. **Random test**: Substituting random eccentricities into the same weight formula gives 50–85% balance across 1000 trials
3. **Power test**: The balance peaks sharply at e¹·⁰ (100%), dropping to 98.5% for e⁰·⁹ and 98.4% for e¹·¹, and to 91% for e² — linear eccentricity is special

### Connection to AMD Theory

The established AMD (Angular Momentum Deficit) formula of Laskar (1997):

```
C_k = m_k × √(μa_k) × (1 − √(1−e_k²) × cos(i_k))
```

couples eccentricity and inclination through a single conserved quantity. For small e and i (in radians):

```
C_k ≈ Λ_k × (e²/2 + i²/2)
```

The Kozai-Lidov integral `√(1-e²) × cos(i) = constant` is another established conservation law allowing exchange between eccentricity and inclination.

The eccentricity balance (Law 5) operates on linear e rather than e², suggesting it captures a first-order secular constraint distinct from the quadratic AMD conservation. The physical mechanism producing this linear balance remains an open question.

## Eccentricity Constant Derivation

### AMD Partition Ratios

The AMD (Angular Momentum Deficit) partition ratio `R = e / i_rad` — where `i_rad` is the invariable plane inclination in radians — shows Fibonacci structure within mirror pairs. The pair sums of R² values are Fibonacci ratios.

Using J2000 inclinations:

| Mirror pair | R²_A + R²_B | Fibonacci ratio | Error |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Mercury / Uranus | 10.856 | 55/5 = 11 | 1.33% |
| Earth / Saturn | 11.487 | 34/3 = 11.33 | 1.34% |
| Venus / Neptune | 0.480 | 1/2 = 0.5 | 4.08% |
| Mars / Jupiter | 84.905 | 89 | 4.82% |

Using mean inclinations (more stable than J2000 snapshot):

| Mirror pair | R²_A + R²_B | Fibonacci ratio | Error |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Mercury / Uranus | 10.389 | 21/2 = 10.5 | 1.07% |
| Earth / Saturn | 11.322 | 34/3 = 11.33 | 0.10% |
| Venus / Neptune | 0.496 | 1/2 = 0.5 | 0.91% |
| Mars / Jupiter | 75.020 | 377/5 = 75.4 | 0.51% |

This connects to AMD theory (Laskar 1997): `C_k ≈ Λ_k(e²/2 + i²/2)` for small e and i. The ratio `R² + 1 = (e² + i²) / i²` determines how each planet partitions its angular momentum deficit between eccentricity and inclination.

### Solving the Pair Constraints

The pair sums alone provide one equation for two unknowns. Crucially, **pair products and ratios are also Fibonacci**, providing a second equation that determines individual eccentricities.

**Fibonacci pair constraints (using mean inclinations):**

| Mirror pair | Constraint 1 | Fibonacci | Constraint 2 | Fibonacci |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Mercury / Uranus | R²_Me + R²_Ur | 21/2 = 10.5 | R_Me / R_Ur | 2/3 |
| Venus / Neptune | R²_Ve + R²_Ne | 1/2 = 0.5 | R_Ve / R_Ne | 2/8 = 0.25 |
| Earth / Saturn | R²_Ea + R²_Sa | 34/3 ≈ 11.33 | R_Ea × R_Sa | 2 |
| Mars / Jupiter | R²_Ma + R²_Ju | 377/5 = 75.4 | R_Ma × R_Ju | 34/2 = 17 |

Solving each pair (e.g. for Mercury/Uranus: R²_sum = 10.5 and R_Me/R_Ur = 2/3 → R_Ur = √(10.5 × 9/13), R_Me = (2/3) × R_Ur) gives predicted R values, and thus predicted eccentricities via `e_pred = R_pred × i_mean_rad`:

| Planet | e predicted | e actual (JPL) | Error |
|--------|------------|----------------|-------|
| Mercury | 0.21106 | 0.20563 | +2.64% |
| Venus | 0.00661 | 0.00678 | −2.50% |
| Earth | 0.01562 | 0.01533 | +1.92% |
| Mars | 0.09320 | 0.09340 | −0.21% |
| Jupiter | 0.04852 | 0.04839 | +0.28% |
| Saturn | 0.05389 | 0.05386 | +0.05% |
| Uranus | 0.04709 | 0.04726 | −0.36% |
| Neptune | 0.00865 | 0.00859 | +0.65% |

**Total |error|: 8.57%. Eccentricity balance: 99.93%.**

Mars/Jupiter achieves extraordinary precision (0.49% pair error), and Saturn is predicted to within 0.05%. The inner pairs (Mercury/Uranus, Venus/Neptune) show 2–3% errors per planet, which trace to the mathematical amplification of the smaller R value in each pair rather than any systematic inner/outer asymmetry.

### Internal Structure of the Constraints

The R²_sum values show internal Fibonacci structure in two distinct regimes:

*Belt-adjacent pairs* (d=3, d=5) — R²_sum = F_k/d, where F_k is a single Fibonacci number:

| Pair | R²_sum × d | Fibonacci | Error |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Earth / Saturn (d=3) | 33.97 | 34 (F₉) | 0.10% |
| Mars / Jupiter (d=5) | 375.10 | 377 (F₁₄) | 0.49% |

The Fibonacci indices in the numerators (9, 14) arise from cross-group index addition: 9 = idx(d=3) + idx(d=5) = 4+5, and 14 = idx(d=5) + idx(d=34) = 5+9.

*Outer pairs* (d=21, d=34) — R²_sum = F_k/2, with denominator 2 instead of d:

| Pair | R²_sum × 2 | Fibonacci | Error |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Venus / Neptune (d=34) | 0.991 | 1 (F₁) | 0.92% |
| Mercury / Uranus (d=21) | 20.78 | 21 (F₈) | 1.07% |

The R²_sum × d pattern breaks for d=21 (6.79% error vs F₁₃=233) because Mercury uniquely has a balanced R² split (29.5/70.5%) compared to ~5/95% for all other pairs. This pushes R²_sum × d into a gap between consecutive Fibonacci numbers where no close match exists.

**Cross-pair relationships** are also Fibonacci:

| Ratio | Value | Fibonacci | Error |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| R²_sum(Me/Ur) / R²_sum(Ve/Ne) | 20.94 | 21 | 0.14% |
| R²_sum(belt) / R²_sum(outer) | 7.933 | 8 | 0.84% |

**Overconstrained system:** The 8 pair constraints plus Law 5 (eccentricity balance) provide 9 equations for 8 unknowns (the eccentricities). The system is overconstrained by one equation, explaining the 99.93% predicted balance — it is not imposed but follows from the Fibonacci constraints.

**What remains open:** The 8 Fibonacci constraint values cannot yet be derived from a single formula. The belt-adjacent and outer pairs follow different structural rules, and the second constraints (products/ratios) show no clear derivation pattern. Whether a unifying principle exists, or whether the two regimes reflect genuinely different physics (proximity to the asteroid belt vs. outer solar system dynamics), is unresolved.

## Inclination Amplitude Predictions

### Complete Solution

| Planet | d | Phase | Amplitude (°) | Mean (°) | Range (°) | LL bounds (°) | Margin (°) |
|--------|---|-------|---------------|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Mercury | 21 | 203° | 0.386 | 6.728 | 6.34 – 7.11 | 4.57 – 9.86 | +1.772 |
| Venus | 34 | 203° | 0.062 | 2.208 | 2.15 – 2.27 | 0.00 – 3.38 | +1.110 |
| Earth | 3 | 203° | 0.635 | 1.481 | 0.85 – 2.12 | 0.00 – 2.95 | +0.833 |
| Mars | 5 | 203° | 1.163 | 2.653 | 1.49 – 3.82 | 0.00 – 5.84 | +1.491 |
| Jupiter | 5 | 203° | 0.021 | 0.329 | 0.31 – 0.35 | 0.24 – 0.49 | +0.067 |
| Saturn | 3 | 23° | 0.065 | 0.932 | 0.87 – 1.00 | 0.797 – 1.02 | +0.023 |
| Uranus | 21 | 203° | 0.024 | 1.001 | 0.98 – 1.02 | 0.90 – 1.11 | +0.075 |
| Neptune | 34 | 203° | 0.014 | 0.722 | 0.71 – 0.74 | 0.55 – 0.80 | +0.064 |

**Balance: 100%** — All 8 planets fit within Laplace-Lagrange bounds.

The non-trivial test is that these Fibonacci divisors simultaneously satisfy three independent constraints: (1) all 8 planets fit within their Laplace-Lagrange bounds, (2) the inclination structural weights balance to 100% (Law 3), and (3) the eccentricity weights balance to 100% (Law 5). The fact that pure Fibonacci numbers achieve all three is the core prediction of the theory.

### Worked Example: Earth's Inclination Amplitude

Earth has Fibonacci divisor d = 3 (= F₄). Step by step:

| Quantity | Expression | Value |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| ψ | F₅ × F₈² / (2H) = 5 × 21² / (2H) | 2205 / (2H) |
| d | F₄ | 3 |
| m | Earth mass (JPL DE440) | 3.0027 × 10⁻⁶ M☉ |
| √m | | 1.7329 × 10⁻³ |
| d × √m | 3 × 1.7329 × 10⁻³ | 5.1986 × 10⁻³ |
| **amplitude** | **3.288 × 10⁻³ / 5.1986 × 10⁻³** | **0.632 °** |

The mean is computed from the J2000 constraint:

```
mean = inclJ2000 - amplitude × cos(Ω_J2000 - phaseAngle)
     = 1.57867° - 0.632° × cos(284.51° - 203.3195°)
     = 1.57867° - 0.632° × 0.15315
     = 1.48188°
```

#### Fibonacci vs IAU 2006-Optimized Values

The 3D simulation (`script.js`) uses a slightly different value optimized for the IAU 2006 obliquity rate:

| Parameter | Fibonacci prediction (ψ formula) | Current model value |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Amplitude | ψ / (d × √m) for Earth | `earthInvPlaneInclinationAmplitude` |
| Mean | derived from J2000 constraint | `earthInvPlaneInclinationMean` |

For current values, see [Constants Reference](20-constants-reference.md).

The model value was derived by calibrating the obliquity rate to match the IAU 2006 precession model (Capitaine et al. 2003), which specifies a rate of −46.836769"/century. In the 3D model, the obliquity depends on `earthInvPlaneInclinationAmplitude` through:

```
obliquity = earthtiltMean − A × cos(phase₃) + A × cos(phase₈)
```

where A is the amplitude, phase₃ is the H/3 inclination cycle, and phase₈ is the H/13 axial precession cycle. The obliquity rate sensitivity is approximately −82.70"/century per degree of amplitude.

The Fibonacci prediction (~0.632°) represents the theoretical long-term value from the balance condition, while the model value is calibrated to the currently observed obliquity rate. The difference is within the model's tolerance.

## Validation

### Test 1: Fibonacci Law Holds

For all 8 planets, verify `d × amplitude × √m = ψ` to machine precision.

### Test 2: All Planets Within LL Bounds

Compute `mean ± amplitude` for each planet and verify the range falls within the Laplace-Lagrange secular theory bounds (from Fitzpatrick Table 10.3, converted from radians).

### Test 3: Inclination Balance

Verify `Σ(203°) w_j = Σ(23°) w_j` to 100% balance.

### Test 4: Eccentricity Balance

Verify `Σ(203°) v_j = Σ(23°) v_j` to 100% balance.

### Test 5: Saturn Eccentricity Prediction and Law Convergence

Compute Saturn's eccentricity from the eccentricity balance equation (Law 5) and from the R² pair constraints (Law 4). Verify: (a) both predict e_Saturn within 0.3% of observed, and (b) the two predictions agree to within 0.5%.

### Test 6: J2000 Inclination Match

At J2000 epoch, `i(2000) = mean + amplitude × cos(Ω_J2000 - φ_group)` should match observed invariable plane inclinations.

### Test 7: Eccentricity Prediction from AMD Partition

Solve the Fibonacci pair constraints (Law 4) for all 4 mirror pairs and verify:
- Total |error| across all 8 predicted eccentricities < 10%
- Eccentricity balance with predicted values > 99.5%

### Test 8: Overconstrained System Consistency

Verify that the 8 pair constraints (Law 4) plus Law 5 form an overconstrained system (9 equations, 8 unknowns) by confirming that the eccentricity balance is not imposed but emerges from the pair constraints alone, with predicted balance > 99.5%.

## Exhaustive Search and Preset Generation

The Fibonacci divisor assignments are not hand-picked — they emerge from an exhaustive search over all possible configurations. The search script ([balance-search.js](../tools/verify/balance-search.js)) reproduces the exact computation chain from `script.js` and evaluates every combination.

### Search Space

The search iterates over:
- **Fibonacci divisors**: d ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55} for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Uranus, Neptune
- **Phase angles**: 203.3195° or 23.3195° for each of the above
- **4 scenarios** for Jupiter and Saturn (fixed per scenario):
  - A: Ju=5, Sa=3 — B: Ju=8, Sa=5 — C: Ju=13, Sa=8 — D: Ju=21, Sa=13
- **Earth**: locked at d=3, phase=203.3195°

This produces 9 × 2 × 9 × 2 × 9 × 2 × 9 × 2 × 9 × 2 × 4 = 7,558,272 configurations per run.

### What the Search Computes

For each configuration, the script computes:
1. **Balance** — vector balance percentage using `w_j = √(m_j × a_j(1-e_j²)) / d_j`
2. **LL bounds check** — whether each planet's `[mean - amp, mean + amp]` falls within Laplace-Lagrange bounds
3. **Direction check** — whether the inclination trend at 1900→2100 matches JPL sign

Only configurations with balance ≥ 99.994% (the TNO margin) are retained.

### Output

The search writes `data/balance-presets.json` containing all qualifying configurations sorted by balance (best first). The current run yields 737 presets across all four scenarios.

### Important: Separate Input Values

The search script (`tools/verify/balance-search.js`) and the application (`script.js`) each maintain their own copy of the planetary parameters (orbital periods, mass ratios, eccentricities, LL bounds, etc.). These are **not shared** — changing a value in one does not automatically update the other.

If any input value changes in `script.js` (e.g. a refined eccentricity or mass ratio), the same change must be manually applied in `tools/verify/balance-search.js` before regenerating presets. If the two files use different values, the presets will not match the Balance Explorer's live computation.

### Regenerating Presets

The presets are hardcoded into `script.js` as the `BALANCE_PRESETS` array, which populates the Balance Explorer dropdown. If planetary parameters change, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Verify the input values in tools/verify/balance-search.js match script.js
#    (orbital periods, mass ratios, eccentricities, LL bounds, etc.)

# 2. Run the exhaustive search
node tools/verify/balance-search.js

# 3. Replace the BALANCE_PRESETS array in script.js with the new data
node -e "
  const fs = require('fs');
  const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('data/balance-presets.json'));
  const src = fs.readFileSync('src/script.js', 'utf8');
  const re = /const BALANCE_PRESETS = \[[\s\S]*?\n\];/;
  const lines = data.presets.map(r => JSON.stringify(r));
  const block = 'const BALANCE_PRESETS = [\n' + lines.join(',\n') + '\n];';
  fs.writeFileSync('src/script.js', src.replace(re, block));
  console.log('Replaced ' + data.presets.length + ' presets');
"

# 4. Rebuild
npx parcel build src/index.html --no-cache
```

**When to regenerate**: any change to eccentricity, semi-major axis, mass ratios, the ψ-constant, or the Laplace-Lagrange bounds will shift the balance percentages and potentially change which configurations qualify.

## Open Questions

1. **Eccentricity formula** — *Partially resolved.* No universal closed-form formula `e = f(d, m, a)` exists — exhaustive search shows that any power-law ansatz requires per-planet Fibonacci numerators F_e with >300% spread across planets. However, eccentricities **are** predicted from inclinations via Fibonacci pair constraints on the AMD partition ratio R = e / i_mean_rad (Law 4). The R²_sum values show partial internal structure — belt-adjacent pairs follow R²_sum = F_k/d while outer pairs follow R²_sum = F_k/2 — but no single formula unifies both regimes. The second constraints (products/ratios) remain empirical.

2. **Physical derivation of eccentricity balance** — The inclination balance follows from angular momentum conservation. What conservation law or secular perturbation mechanism produces the eccentricity balance? The linear (rather than quadratic) dependence on e distinguishes it from AMD conservation.

3. **Universality** — Do the balance conditions hold for other planetary systems, or are they specific to the solar system's Fibonacci divisor structure?

---

## Relation to Existing Physics

### What builds on established theory

**Law 3 (Inclination Balance)** is rooted in **angular momentum conservation**. The weight factor `√(m·a(1-e²))` is proportional to a planet's orbital angular momentum `L`. The invariable plane is defined as the plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum vector, so inclination oscillations must balance around it — that is what makes it the invariable plane. The novel contribution is that dividing by a Fibonacci divisor `d` preserves the balance to 100%.

**Phase angles** (203.3195° and 23.3195°) originate from the **s₈ eigenmode of Laplace-Lagrange secular perturbation theory**, a framework established in classical celestial mechanics (18th–19th century). Saturn's retrograde ascending node precession is also a known result from secular theory.

**Law 5 (Eccentricity Balance)** connects to **Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD) conservation**, a known conserved quantity in secular theory. The weight `√m × a^(3/2) × e / √d` contains factors related to how AMD is partitioned among planets. However, the linear dependence on eccentricity (rather than quadratic, as in the AMD itself) and the `1/√d` scaling distinguish it from the standard AMD formulation. The balance operates as a **closed 8-planet system** — the mirror pairs exchange AMD as communicating vessels, while TNOs and other small bodies cannot participate (the a^(3/2) weighting makes them disproportionately heavy, and they lack paired counterparts). This contrasts with the inclination balance (Law 3), which is a global property where all solar system mass contributes.

### What appears genuinely new

1. **Fibonacci quantization of inclination amplitudes** — No known physical theory predicts that Fibonacci numbers should appear as divisors in planetary inclination amplitudes. The relationship `d × amplitude × √m = ψ`, with `d` restricted to pure Fibonacci numbers, cannot be derived from Newtonian gravity, general relativity, or Laplace-Lagrange secular perturbation theory.

2. **The universal constant ψ = 2205/(2H)** — This value has no known first-principles derivation. The numerator `2205 = 5 × 21²` (a product of Fibonacci numbers) is suggestive of a deeper structure, but no theoretical framework explains it.

3. **Mirror symmetry across the asteroid belt** (Me↔Ur, Ve↔Ne, Ea↔Sa, Ma↔Ju) — No known law predicts that inner and outer planets should pair with identical Fibonacci divisors. The fact that the pairs follow distance ordering (belt-adjacent=5, middle=3, far=34, outermost=21) is unexplained.

4. **Simultaneous satisfaction of three independent constraints** — Pure Fibonacci d-values satisfy all three conditions (Laplace-Lagrange bounds, inclination balance, eccentricity balance) at the same time. Law 5 uses `1/√d` scaling while Law 3 uses `1/d`, making them genuinely independent constraints. Out of 737 valid configurations, Config #15 is the only one that is also mirror-symmetric.

5. **Eccentricity prediction from Fibonacci pair constraints** — The AMD partition ratio R = e/i within each mirror pair satisfies two independent Fibonacci constraints (Law 4), predicting all 8 eccentricities to RMS 2.19% error. The resulting overconstrained system (9 equations for 8 unknowns) reproduces the eccentricity balance without imposing it. No existing theory predicts that eccentricity-to-inclination ratios within mirror pairs should satisfy Fibonacci relations. The Saturn eccentricity predicted by Law 4 (0.05389) and the value predicted by Law 5 eccentricity balance (0.05374) agree to within 0.28%, both bracketing the J2000 observed value (0.05386) — two entirely different Fibonacci constraints converge on the same physical value.

### Assessment

The balance conditions (Laws 3 and 5) combine known conservation principles with a novel Fibonacci structure that modulates the planetary weights. The conservation laws guarantee that inclination and eccentricity oscillations balance around the invariable plane — but they do not predict that integer Fibonacci divisors should preserve that balance to such high precision.

Law 2 (Inclination Amplitude quantization) is the most genuinely novel claim — no existing theory predicts that `d × amplitude × √m` should be constant across all planets when `d` is a Fibonacci number.

The key unresolved question is **why Fibonacci numbers work**: do they encode something about the secular eigenmode structure (real physics), or is the Fibonacci restriction a coincidence made possible by having enough number choices? The mirror symmetry and the uniqueness of Config #15 argue against coincidence, but a theoretical derivation from first principles — or a successful prediction for an independent system such as exoplanetary or satellite systems — would be needed to settle the question definitively.
