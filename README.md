# 🌌 Solar System build in three js R175 - Summary

## ✅ Core Architecture

- **Planet creation 
- **Supports:**  
  - Planet tilts and custom orbit inclinations  
  - Optional ring textures  
  - Emissive + textured planets  
  - Non-planet objects (barycenters, cycles) using `MeshBasicMaterial`
  - Starfield background and constellations

---

## 🔦 Lighting & Shadows

- **Primary light:** `DirectionalLight` simulating the Sun
- **Dynamic shadow frustum:** Updated based on focused planet
- **Fallback `PointLight`:** Used when the Sun itself is selected (ensures visibility)
- **Shadows:** Enabled only for true planets (not trace objects)

---

## 🌈 Materials

- **Planets:** `MeshPhongMaterial` with bump, specular, and emissive options
- **Trace objects (e.g., Barycenter):**  
  `MeshBasicMaterial`  
  with optional dimmed texture (`color: 0x888888`) or fallback color

---

## 🛰️ Scene Structure

Each planet is structured like this:
- `orbitContainer` → holds full orbit structure
- `orbit` → holds orbit visuals and pivot
- `pivotObj` → origin point offset to simulate eccentricity
- `rotationAxis` → applies axial tilt
- `planetMesh` → spherical geometry, holds material
- `ringObj` (optional) → Saturn-style rings
- `axisHelperObj` (optional) → debugging aid

---

## 🎯 Camera and Focus System

- Focused object stored in `o.lookAtObj`
- Camera `controls.target` updates each frame to follow focus
- Light and ring center dynamically update with the focused object
- Default focus on Earth

---

## ✨ Visual Effects

- **Focus ring:** Shown around Sun’s barycenter when Sun is selected
- **Sun glow:** Dynamically scaled by camera distance
- **Name tags and constellations:** Fading and scaling based on camera distance
- **DOM overlay label:** Follows selected planet on screen

---

## 🧠 UI Logic

- `dat.GUI` panel bound to visibility states like:
  - Zodiac glow toggle

---

## ✅ Suggestions for Next Steps

- 🌑 Technical improvements (can we prevent the camera swings when looking at the sun?)
- 🌟 Visual improvements
- 🖼 Export frames for video or screenshots
- 🕶 Integrate with `WebXR` for VR solar system flythrough
