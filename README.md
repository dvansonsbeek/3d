# üåå Solar System Simuation build in three js

The Interactive 3D Solar System Simulation shows the precession / eccentricity / inclination / obliquity / perihelion date movements of Earth, Moon, Sun and Planets modelled from a geo-heliocentric frame of reference, coming together in a Holistic-Year cycle of 305,952 years, an Axial precession cycle of ~23,535 years, an Inclination precession cycle of 101,984 years and a Perihelion precession cycle of 19,122 years. 

The way it is modelled:
* The EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER is the center of our solar system.
* Earth is wobbling clockwise around the EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER in a period of ~23,535 solar years, also known as Axial precession and therefore the Axial tilt changes.
* The HELION-POINT is orbiting the EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER - and therefore Earth - counter-clockwise in a period of 101,984 solar years, also known as Inclination precession and therefore the inclination tilt changes.
* Axial precession meets Inclination precession every 19,122 years.
* Our Sun is orbiting the HELION-POINT in a period of 1 solar year.
* Therefore it shows as if the Sun is orbiting Earth.

How you could also see it:
* The HELION-POINT is the center of our solar system.
* Earth is wobbling clockwise around the EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER in a period of ~23,535 solar years, also known as Axial precession and therefore the Axial tilt changes.
* The EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER - and therefore Earth - is orbiting the HELION-POINT counter-clockwise in a period of 101,984 solar years, also known as Inclination precession and therefore the inclination tilt changes.
* Axial precession meets Inclination precession every 19,122 years.
* Our Sun is orbiting the HELION-POINT in a period of 1 solar year.
* Therefore it shows as if the Sun is orbiting Earth.

What is actually happening:
* The Sun is (still) the center of our solar system.
* Earth is wobbling clockwise around the EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER in a period of ~23,535 solar years, also known as Axial precession and therefore the Axial tilt changes.
* The HELION-POINT of Earth is orbiting the Sun counter-clockwise in a period of 101,984 solar years, also known as Inclination precession and therefore the inclination tilt changes.
* Axial precession meets Inclination precession every 19,122 years.
* Earth is orbiting the HELION-POINT of Earth - close to the Sun - in a period of 1 solar year.
* Therefore it shows Earth is actually orbiting the Sun.
* So we still live in a Heliocentric solar system

* All planets in our solar system are orbiting the Sun but have a barycenter just outside of the Sun.
* The location of the barycenters of the planets are structured according to the Golden Spiral pattern around the Sun and the planets are orbiting these barycenters according to Kepler‚Äôs 3rd law.

Additional explanation to understand the model:
* The inclination (J2000 value ~1.57869¬∞) and axial tilt together result in the obliquity of Earth‚Äôs axis (J2000 value +23¬∞26'21").
* There are only two counter movements around Earth working against each other in a ratio of 3:13 ; Inclination:Axial which explains all movements around Earth (precession, eccentricity, obliquity, inclination, etc)
* The currently experienced precession is NOT the mean value and all precession movements are always experienced in the same ratio (e.g. experienced perihelion precession is 13/16th of Axial precession: ~25,771*13/16 = ~20,939 years)
* The Perihelion precession cycle of 19,122 years determines the natural cycles of the length of solar days, sidereal days, solar years, sidereal years and anomalistic years.
* The EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER was aligned in 1246 AD with the HELION-POINT and therefore the length of solar year in days and the length of sidereal year in seconds were MEAN in 1246 AD.
* The difference between the sidereal day - stellar day leads to the difference solar year ‚Äì sidereal year because the location of the EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER is at a MEAN ratio of 1:366.2422341 compared to the Sun: 1 second movement is (mean) amplified ~366.2422341 times.

Why is the length of the Holistic-Year 305,952 years? This number fits all observations best:
1. Historic value longitude of perihelion 90¬∞: 1245-12-14
2. Current (J2000) value longitude of perihelion: 6h51m47s = ~102.945¬∞
3. The Length of solar day, solar year in days, sidereal year in seconds aligned to 3D longitude values and historic values
a) 1246 Length of solar day in days was ~365.242236 days (which is ~31,556,929.19 SI seconds in Ephemeris time).
b) 1246 Length of sidereal year in SI seconds was ~31,558,149.6847
c) 1246 Length of solar day was above 86,400 SI seconds because of historic Delta T predictions.
4. Climate graphs with ~100k cycles as a cycle of 305,952 years
5. End of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) around 21,000 BC and end of Younger dryes around 9800 BC. 
6. The location of the EARTH-WOBBLE-CENTER is at a MEAN ratio of 1:366.2422341 compared to the location the Sun as seen from Earth
7. Obliquity correct both historic and current values
8. Orbital Inclination to ICRF correct both historic and current values
9. Eccentricity correct both historic and current values

Technical: 

Build in Three js R175 including orbitcontrols.

It's an interactive 3D visualization where the browser renders a miniature model of the solar system using three.js ‚Äî a JavaScript library that simplifies working with WebGL. The project typically features:
- A central sun: A bright, glowing sphere, possibly using a texture and some light emission effects.
- Orbiting planets: Each planet is a textured sphere with individual rotation (spinning) and revolution (orbiting) animations.
- Orbit paths: Visualized with faint circles or lines showing the paths of the planets.
- Lighting: A combination of ambient and point lights to simulate how the sun lights up the planets.
- Camera controls: Using something like OrbitControls to let the user zoom, pan, and rotate around the system.
- Scaling: Distances are to scale but sizes of the planets are not to scale because realistic proportions would make some planets almost invisible or too far apart.
- Extras: You might see moons orbiting planets, rings around Saturn, zodiac positions, polar axis line,constellation or even starfield backgrounds to make it more immersive.

At a basic level, it's like building a tiny universe in the browser, where JavaScript, math (especially trigonometry), and 3D graphics all work together.
